# phase-1-project-insurance-discount
Project set-up:
The project file described below contains: index.html (DOM), style.css(styling), index.js (script)

The insurance sales agents are offering discount to vehicle brands which are in an online respository: The program prompts the agents to input their clients' vehicle model. if the vehicle model is in the respository, the app qualifies the vehicle for discount.

This saves time that the agent takes crosschecking a client's vehicle against the respository of approved vehicles. The client can as well confirm if his/her vehicle qualifies for insurance discount online, thus can make better decision in deciding which vehicle to buy.
